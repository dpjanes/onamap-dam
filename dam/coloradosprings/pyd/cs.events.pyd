For over 43 years, Lila has actively embraced a vocal career as both a jazz artist and a classical artist, and as a vocal educator. She has appeared as the featured soloist with The Colorado Springs Philharmonic, Colorado Springs Symphony, The Pikes Peak Civic Orchestra, the Broadmoor Pops Orchestra, and The Ken Miller Orchestra. For twenty-four years, audiences have thrilled to Lila's performances with the Penrose Room Trio and the Ken Miller Trio every Wednesday through Saturday Broadmoor Hotel.\n\nJana Lee Ross is a musician with a repertoire that blurs the lines between classical music and jazz. She is in demand as a versatile soloist and sideman incorporating Bach, Bebop, Bill Evans, Bjork, and David Bowie into her personalized sound. After spending a not-so-wild youth as a not-quite-starving actress, she decided that she is most at home piloting a piano. That choice has planted her steadily at the honky-tonk upright of the Iron Springs Chateau and the baby grands of the Broadmoor Hotel. You can also catch her with the punk-jazz combo Jana Lee and the Powers That Be.",

Navarro\\\'s release "Dreaming of Trains" was pre-nominated for the Grammy awards in 2 categories and his album \\"Ruby Lane\\" spent 4 months in the Top 10 at contemporary/smooth jazz radio, streaming, iTunes and Amazon. "Music For Guitar and Orchestra" was Navarro\'s first recording with a symphony orchestra. On the smooth jazz chart at <em>Billboard</em> magazine, his song "You Are Everything" reached No. 6,<a>]</a> "Juliet" reached No. 7, "When We Dance" reached No. 11 and "Ruby Lane" reached No. 10.  His musically diverse discography appeals to a wide range of listeners with inspiring compositions and superb guitar performances.\n\nJazziz magazine writes that Nelson Rangell is "an artist of depth, a master of song, and an improviser non pareil."  The Times of London notes "his extraordinary facility on a range of instruments" and Rangell\'s "considerable crowd pleasing power."  Saxophone Journal writes "He commands the alto saxophone with such authority there can be no denying that Rangell is a true artist."  Such praise is a confirmation of what contemporary jazz fans have know since the Denver based saxophonist emerged in the late 80s; that Rangell is one of the most exciting and diverse performers in the genre, equally adept at soprano, alto, and tenor saxophone, as well as being a genuine virtuoso on flute and piccolo. He has recorded with The Rippingtons, Chuck Loeb, Patti Austin, Tom Browne and The GRP All Star Big Band to name a few. With his discography of now 17 CD releases Nelson Rangell continues on his musical path with two new and very unique albums, "Red," a collection of dedicated saxophone recording in the pop jazz and contemporary jazz idiom and "Blue" which features the flute and piccolo throughout it\'s highly artistic and diverse 11 tracks.',

 {'content': u'All three current members, Mike Marvin, Tim Gorelangton, and Don Marovich have intrinsic links to and experience with the original group: Mike is the adopted son of founding member Nick Reynolds, who was also his musical mentor; Tim, a close friend since boyhood, is one of the few musicians outside the Trio who has recorded with Nick Reynolds; and Don Marovich, who also toured with the Trio.\n\nMany of their personal memories recall the iconic trio\'s performances and journey as folk music made its extraordinary ascent to the pinnacle of popular culture - and the top of the music charts. They\'ll perform such timeless classics "Where Have All The Flowers Gone?" and "Tom Dooley."\n\nThe Trio released 19 albums that made Billboard\'s Top 100, 14 of which ranked in the top 10, and five of which hit the number 1 spot. Four of the group\'s LPs charted among the 10 top-selling albums for five weeks in November and December 1959, a record unmatched for more than 50 years, and the group still ranks in the all-time lists of many of Billboard\'s cumulative charts, including those for most weeks with a number 1 album, most total weeks charting an album, most number 1 albums, most consecutive number 1 albums, and most top ten albums.',

Muji Rieger began to acquire his arts education at an early age. As a local rapscallion child, he would bother local artists in their studios, offering to assist in exchange for tutelage. In his youth he left home and studied Arabic Calligraphy and sat in seclusion with the Sarwari Qadri Sufi Order. Upon his return to Colorado, Muji co-founded the Knob Hill Urban Arts District as its Executive Director. The images Muji invokes in his work invite comfort to the disturbed and disturb the comfortable with notions ranging from chaos theory to carnal raw emotion. His work  highlights and harnesses the cracks and imperfections that exist in nature to create evocative images  that appeal not just to the eye, but to the viewer's primal definition of beauty.",

I am an artist with many interest. I have tried just about every form of art, but my favorites portraits with abstract art occasionally. My biggest inspiration are cartoons that have a diverse cast of characters.\n\n<strong>Malachi Clark:</strong> Hello everyone! I am 17 years old. I have a disability and I am a recent Widefield high school graduate! I love to express myself through the art of poetry!\n\n<strong>Marqel Wilson:</strong> I am a 19 year old artist born and raised in Colorado. The type of art I do is categorized as hyperrealism art. I fell in love with art the moment I saw my mom's pictures she did as a kid. I was astonished by how real it looked and just the amount of detail she displayed. It blew my mind that you could use a pencil to make something look so life-like, and ever since that moment I've fallen in love with hyperrealism art.\n\n<strong>Kendrick Trujillo: </strong>When individuals see my work, I want people to see the beauty in humanity. As a species, we are far from perfection, but when I take photos I want to express what makes us great.  I personally believe that I was put on earth to be an artist. I'm a proud black artist from Denver which is such a privilege. Being a creative is in my blood.",

Each year, our local Litter Letter Project produces a unique piece of sculptural art that is constructed with trash collected from public lands and waterways during Creek Week. Modeled after the national Litter Letter Project, and with permission to use their logo and concept, our local Litter Letter Project is a fun and inspiring annual event that signals the official start of Arts Month. It\'s also a wonderful cross-sector collaboration between the Arts, Outdoor Recreation, and Environmental sectors that benefits the entire region!\n\nOn Friday, October 1st at 4:00PM, just before the start of First Friday, there will be a dedication ceremony for the 2021 Litter Letter art piece. The dedication event is free and open to the public, and will feature brief remarks by project partners and community leaders. Light snacks and refreshments will be provided, as well as live musical entertainment courtesy of the <a href="https://www.peakradar.com/artist-type/curbside-culture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Curbside Culture</a> program.\n\nFollowing the dedication event, everyone is invited to celebrate the start of Arts Month 2021 by participating in the October First Friday Art Walks from 5-8PM along the Avenue Creative Circuit in Downtown Colorado Springs, Old Colorado City, and Manitou Springs. Throughout the month of October, the local community is also invited to support our Litter Letter Project though a special social media campaign on Instagram, by using the hashtag #PikesPeakLitterLetters to show us how you recreate responsibly, and RESPECT the outdoors.\n\nMedia inquiries and questions about the project should be directed to Andy Vick at <a href="mailto:andy@CulturalOffice.org">andy@CulturalOffice.org</a>.',

There will be a limited number of tickets available for two different dinner seatings: 5:00-7:00PM, and 7:30-9:30PM. Guests are encouraged to arrive early to enjoy the art, and chat with the artist and exhibit curator. Stay tuned for the ticket launch on Facebook in September!\n\nEphemera began as a series of multi-sensory Pop-Up Dinners in early 2018 by Chefs Ian Dedrickson and Adam Ridens, and Creative Director Jasmine Dillavou. The passion project quickly evolved into a regular series of themed dinners held in locations varying from restaurants, to friends\' apartments, to Colorado Springs-area farms, and has now progressed to the next step of a brick-and-mortar location, upstairs in the beautiful CO.A.T.I. building in the New South End of downtown Colorado Springs.\n\n<strong>Read more about our featured artist:</strong>\n\nSophia Hanna, 21, has grown up immersed in the arts community of Colorado Springs. Some of her first pieces debuted in the SPQR and Modbo Small Works show when she was eleven. She has sold numerous works and commissions from the age of twelve, diving wholeheartedly into her first oil painting class in 2017, exhibiting her first solo oil show the following year. Her most recent full body of work was for a joint oil show at local gallery SPQR in 2019, and in 2020 she was honored to participate in the Gratitude show at the Kreuser Gallery. She is currently focusing on her mental health and has been experimenting with integrating that journey into more honest art. Sophia most often paints figurative oil paintings leaning towards magical realism. She particularly likes to make "weird" art. You know it when you see it.',

 {'content': u'<strong>First Friday. Undesirable Plants Declare: A Participatory Public Review</strong>\n\n<em>Undesirable Plants Declare*</em> brings the Environmental Performance Agency\'s work to the unceded territory of the Ute, Cheyenne, Arapaho Peoples, to investigate the diverse multispecies lifeways and teachings of spontaneous urban plants (aka weeds). Asking "In a time of ongoing pandemic crisis, how do we revalue what care means for all living beings?", the exhibition shares and extends the EPA\'s Multispecies Care Survey, a public engagement and data gathering initiative that aims to cultivate the co-generation of embodied, localized plant-human care practices. Launched during the height of the COVID-19 crisis, the Survey is an interactive web platform (multispecies.care) featuring a collection of participatory methods for attuning to vegetal perspectives and working with spontaneous urban plants as guides, collaborators, and mentors while social distancing. In the exhibition\'s archive space, visitors can view video documentation of entries collected during the 2020-21 Survey cycle, explore the survey directly, and actively participate by engaging in a new protocol developed for this exhibition.\n\nIn the entryway to the gallery, visitors are introduced to a delegation of EPA weedy plant experts from New York City, and invited to assist the EPA in assessing the capabilities and wisdom of local "undesirable" plant expert Spotted Knapweed (<em>Centaurea maculosa</em>). Through this Public Review with Knapweed, the EPA asks: What are the qualities, perspectives, skills, and relations that Knapweed can bring to the EPA? Participate in public fieldwork by listening, observing, and moving with urban plants, then share your sensorial experiences and Knapweed knowledge on the collaborative Public Review Diagram in the gallery.\n\nThe EPA will ultimately use this research in drafting a new piece of policy, The Multispecies Act. This Act aims to offer a set of embodied, actionable principles for centering spontaneous urban plant life as one means (among many) of contending with the failure of our environmental regulatory apparatus to deliver policy that promotes reciprocal relations between human and nonhuman life.',

 {'content': u'In celebration of Arts Month 2021, The Space is honored to present \'Muliebrity,\' an exploration of Hispanic heritage and femininity featuring surrealist works by Mel CK and Tara Gonzalez, curated by Jasmine Dillavou. This featured exhibition opens on Friday, October 1 and will highlight latinx artists with live painting, music, and more.\n\nMel CK is from Panama City, Panama, first generation American. She came to the US and grew up in Colorado Springs. Her art is street surrealism influenced by South American street art - a combination created from American hip-hop and cumbia culture. CK says, "My home life and the outside world collided together in me." One can see this in her characters and illustrations being an exaggeration of human anatomy, flora and fauna. The bright colors in Mel\'s work are a tribute to her latin roots and the way she sees the world. Colorful.\n\nTara is a Mexican-American artist based out of Colorado where she was born and raised. Tara received her BA in Art Education and taught for Denver Public Schools. She began focusing on her own work when she moved to California and became inspired by San Francisco\'s culture. Tara has been honoring all that truly inspires her, which is the subject matter of her art. Her work is a reflection of childlike wonder that is like a blissful state obtained in a memory or dream. The pieces are linked cohesively with reoccurring organic shape and saturated colors that draw viewers into an evolving environment. Tara aspires to strengthen her skills in various mediums and to share her passion for empowering others creativity. You can visit her studio at the Cottonwood Center.',

 {'content': u'<strong>In celebration of October is Arts Month,</strong> Rocky Mountain Women\'s Film will be screening "Born to Fly: Elizabeth Streb vs. Gravity," a film that traces the evolution of choreographer and "extreme action architect" Elizabeth Streb and her more than 30 years of movement philosophy.\n\n<strong>About the Film:</strong>\n\nAs a choreographer of dance and performance art, Elizabeth Streb has consistently pushed the boundaries of her craft. Her work openly questions why dance can\'t be explosive, action oriented, and extreme, yet just as captivating as ballet. Over the years she has worked to create a unique performance company that melds the physical with the sublime, and her troupe\'s fearless performances in both public and private spaces challenge the notion of what the body can do.\n\nBorn to Fly: Elizabeth Streb vs. Gravity is the story of the groundbreaking choreographer sometimes called "the Evel Knievel of dance." In over 30 years of practice, she has pioneered a movement form called "POPACTION," which is couched in the exploration of human potential - both physical and emotional.\n\nAs seen in the film, Streb\'s dancers become part acrobat, part gymnast, and part extreme thrill seeker as they walk on walls, dive through glass, and move so fast they seem to disappear and fly. Born to Fly culminates with Streb and her dancers preparing and presenting gravity-defying performances in London\'s Cultural Olympiad leading up to the 2012 Olympics.\n\n<strong>About the Drive-In:\n</strong>\n\nRMWF Drive-in Cinema is located at the former Gazette Building, just east of downtown.  Special thanks to Nor\'wood Development Group, our event sponsor.\n\nThe parking lot opens at 6:00 p.m., when we will welcome you with free <strong>popcorn</strong>! We encourage attendees to <b>tailgate </b>and socialize before the film program begins promptly at 7:00 p.m.  Get settled in your vehicle, turn the radio up, and enjoy a great film on a great big screen under the stars.\n\nAlternatively, and weather permitting, we will set up a speaker system for sound, so bring a <strong>camp chair</strong> and layers to enjoy the film al fresco.',

 {'content': u'Jeremy Facknitz has been entertaining audiences with his lovingly crafted music and high-energy performances for over 20 years. Since the 2002 break-up of his Detroit-based band "The Ottomans" (2001 Detroit Music Award Winner, Best New Alternative Band), Jeremy has performed primarily as a solo act, sharing through an often quirky fusion of folk-rock and jazz his intimate stories of life, love, and self-discovery.\n\nBut from 2003 to 2017 those stories, for the most part, fell on deaf ears. Facknitz carved out a living performing at bars, coffeeshops, and corporate events while teaching lessons on the side. "I was happy to be making a living performing music, but my original music wasn\'t being heard, and as the years passed I found myself more and more frustrated playing to little more than the din of drunken conversation." Things came to a head on July 17th, 2017 when Jeremy was diagnosed with viral meningitis. "I came face to face with my mortality, and I realized it was time for a change. I quit the bars and spent the next year making the leap to house concerts, touring, and performing solely for listening audiences."\n\nThe leap has paid off. Jeremy was named a top 24 finalist from over 700 entries in the 2020 Grassy Hill Kerrville New Folk Songwriting Competition at Kerrville Folk Festival. His song "Ballet of an Unhatched Chick" was awarded semi-finalist distinction at <strong><a class="oajrlxb2 g5ia77u1 qu0x051f esr5mh6w e9989ue4 r7d6kgcz rq0escxv nhd2j8a9 nc684nl6 p7hjln8o kvgmc6g5 cxmmr5t8 oygrvhab hcukyx3x jb3vyjys rz4wbd8a qt6c0cv9 a8nywdso i1ao9s8h esuyzwwr f1sip0of lzcic4wl py34i1dx gpro0wi8" role="link" href="http://songoftheyear.com/?fbclid=IwAR01FPin_YTV7ptdp-g6rTCftsCaC_9beOiL818j0x7HXRUa2g9bgorRh6M" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">songoftheyear.com</a></strong> for 2020.

One popular musician described Chad\'s lyrics as "beautiful yet bittersweet." Musical pedigree runs deep in Chad\'s Midwestern roots. His cousins, The Carter Family, could always be heard in the Traxler house growing up. (June Carter was Johnny Cash\'s wife.) This explains the classic country overtones in Chad\'s guitar rhythms.\n\nChad is currently collaborating with Talia Jade, a cellist, and percussionist who recently performed in Carnegie Hall. In addition to Chad\'s originals, the duo covers a wide range of genres - rock, pop, country, and Latin - in their own unique, acoustic style.',

 {'content': u'Theatreworks opens their season with \'<em>Witch\'</em> written by Jen Silverman and directed by Caitlin Lowans.\n\nA woman - who may be a witch - thinks fast when a man - who\'s definitely the devil - comes knocking in this dark comedy based on a Jacobean classic.\n\nMischief is afoot in the sleepy village of Edmonton and the fate of the world is at stake in this smart modern fable. When the emotionally conflicted son of the local lord and an ambitious newcomer come into conflict, help presents itself to both of them in the same guise--as the Devil himself. But while these two young men take advantage of the Devil\'s bargain to accomplish their own questionable ends, someone else in town stands her ground--Elizabeth, an outcast whom everyone believes to be a witch.\n\nWitch content advisory: This production includes strong language, a moment of violence, insults about potlucks, and posits the existence of the Devil.

Sarah created art programs for elementary schools, directed church and community music programs, and collaborated with college students.

She is in demand as a versatile soloist and sideman incorporating Bach, Bebop, Bill Evans, Bjork, and David Bowie into her personalized sound. After spending a not-so-wild youth as a not-quite-starving actress, she decided that she is most at home piloting a piano. That choice has planted her steadily at the honky-tonk upright of the Iron Springs Chateau and the baby grands of the Broadmoor Hotel. You can also catch her with the punk-jazz combo Jana Lee and the Powers That Be.',

He quickly became a staple of the state's honky-tonk circuit and enjoyed regional success on radio as well. Having more or less established himself as a purely Texas artist, he shifted slightly toward a more contemporary sound at the start of the next decade.\n\nThe results spoke for themselves when he began to find a mainstream audience and chart nationally with releases like 2012'sReal Good Time and 2015's breakout The Underdog, which hit number one on Billboard's Top Country Albums chart. Even more impressive is that he achieved all of this without a record label. Rather than sign on with a major, Aaron continued to work independently, issuing albums like 2019's Red Bandana and 2021's American Soul on his own Big Label imprint.\n\nOpening Performance:\n\n<strong>The SofaKillers</strong> were votes best local band of Colorado Springs in 2019, 2020, &amp; 202 by Gazette readers!

We will also practice a popular image transfer technique and compare the results to collage to discover exciting ways to use both methods.\n\nOften, when playing with collage items, a message or theme develops, seemingly like magic.

The event is free and open to the public, and is part of the annual <a href="https://artsoctober.com/special-program/poetry719-festival/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Poetry719 Festival</a>.\n\n<em>"I think I wanted to be the poet laureate really to diversify what poetry looks like. Poetry is largely super academic. It is largely a little bit older in age, and typically pretty white. And so as a younger black woman in this field, I wanted to just create more representation for poetry in the community. I also grew up here and have a really strong devotion to just making Colorado Springs a more safe and open space for folks." </em><em>-- Ashley Cornelius</em>\n\nThe evenings activities will be emceed by former Pikes Peak Poet Laureate, Susan Peiffer. The program will feature:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Opening remarks by Pikes Peak Library District (PPLD) Chief Librarian &amp; CEO, John Spears</li>\n \t<li>Performances by local poets (TBD)</li>\n \t<li>Past Poet Laureate Performances by Price Strobridge, Aaron Anstett (invited), and Susan Peiffer</li>\n \t<li>Installation Ceremony, and performance by Poet Laureate, Ashley Cornelius</li>\n</ul>\nFollowing the inauguration event, Poetry719 will host a Silent Disco in honor of the new Poet Laureate, starting at 9PM. Tickets are $10/person. For questions, please email <a href="mailto:poetry719info@gmail.com">poetry719info@gmail.com</a>.\n\nThe Pikes Peak Library District (PPLD) is proud to be the administrator for the Pikes Peak Poet Laureate program. The Poet Laureate builds a literary arts community through poetry by developing an appreciation of written and performance poetry, and by inspiring and celebrating poetry and poets in the Pikes Peak region with dynamic programs of engagement, advocacy, and education.',

Weeks Three and Four focus on his famously horrific plays: Macbeth and Titus Andronicus.\n\nThe explorations in each week will include scene readings and historical context.

 {'content': u'"Undesirable Plants Declare: A Participatory Public Review" brings the Environmental Performance Agency\'s work to the un-ceded territory of the Ute, Cheyenne, Arapaho Peoples, to investigate the diverse multispecies lifeways and teachings of spontaneous urban plants (aka weeds). Asking "In a time of ongoing pandemic crisis, how do we revalue what care means for all living beings?" the exhibition shares and extends the EPA\'s Multispecies Care Survey, a public engagement and data gathering initiative that aims to cultivate the co-generation of embodied, localized plant-human care practices.\n\nLaunched during the height of the COVID-19 crisis, the Survey is an interactive web platform (multispecies.care) featuring a collection of participatory methods for attuning to vegetal perspectives and working with spontaneous urban plants as guides, collaborators, and mentors while social distancing. In the exhibition\'s archive space, visitors can view video documentation of entries collected during the 2020-21 Survey cycle, explore the survey directly, and actively participate by engaging in a new protocol developed for this exhibition.\n\nIn the entryway to the gallery, visitors are introduced to a delegation of EPA weedy plant experts from New York City, and invited to assist the EPA in assessing the capabilities and wisdom of local "undesirable" plant expert Spotted Knapweed (Centaurea maculosa). Through this Public Review with Knapweed, the EPA asks: What are the qualities, perspectives, skills, and relations that Knapweed can bring to the EPA? Participate in public fieldwork by listening, observing, and moving with urban plants, then share your sensorial experiences and Knapweed knowledge on the collaborative Public Review Diagram in the gallery.',

 {'content': u"Brenda Stumpf makes art to conjure the mysterious and enchanted -- to dive into the dark and hide in the secretive. As she works, she is often feeling her way towards something that seems deep, ancient, and timeless by way of the abstract and symbolic.\n\nWorking intuitively, Stumpf does not plan or sketch her ideas prior to creating. She has a compulsion to make intricate use of nontraditional and found materials in a way that is akin to alchemy -- imbuing them with and transmuting them to an elevated sense of meaning, whether on intimate or physically massive scales.\n\nStumpf's work has referenced female historic and mythic figures such as Pandora, Seshat, the Black Madonna, Hatshepsut, the victims of Jack the Ripper, and the women of the Inquisitions. She has also delved into her personal history, playing with nostalgia and memory, and she continues to be inspired by the works of composer Arvo Pa?rt and the poetry of Pablo Neruda and Rainer Maria Rilke.\n\nFrom Stumpf's perspective, there is profound healing in the creation of art; it provides the transcendent conditions necessary to understanding and mending one's life and ancestral lineage as well as relieving the collective pain body. For her, creating art is a mystical and alchemical process, and she works within a shamanic environ that transcends time and space.",

The opening reception is from 5 pm until 9 pm on Friday, October 1st.  Cho explores in the combination of Asian art with contemporary art to portray the traditional Korean silk wrapping (Bojagi) and its abstract form as a metaphor for coverings of how we lose ourselves, what we keep inside, and how it is reflected. As of this writing, masks are suggested for unvaccinated viewers.\n\nIn addition to the opening reception, the gallery is happily open by appointment.\n\n<strong>About the Show:</strong>\n\nSu Kaiden Cho condenses a central belief that lies at the core of his artistic practice by delving into issues of ethnic liminality by means of quality of ambiguity or disorientation of identity. Cho\'s series of "I was," "I am," "I will be," are the connections to his heritage but are also reminders of the loss of identity he has had to endure. The first phrase "I was," is dormant, because the past is fixed. You can\'t change it and you can\'t manipulate it in any way. The second phrase,"I was," is present. In the present is the only time we need to center ourselves. As for the last, "I will be," references moving forward to whatever may come into its life. Cho explores in the combination of Asian art with contemporary art to portray the traditional Korean silk wrapping (Bojagi) and its abstract form as a metaphor for coverings of how we lose ourselves, what we keep inside, and how it is reflected. Cho sees this exhibit as an opportunity for any viewers to fill in those phrases with their own experiences, and to take the time to reflect on their own life trajectory -Cho states that the truth is hardly ever on the surface, more often than not, the truth can only be found deep inside.\n\n<strong>About the Artist:</strong>\n\nCho explores in the combination of Asian art with contemporary art to portray the traditional Korean silk wrapping (Bojagi) and its abstract form as a metaphor for coverings of how we lose ourselves, what we keep inside, and how it is reflected. Su Kaiden Cho was born and raised in Seoul, South Korea. Cho is a Korean contemporary artist and he now resides and works in Colorado. Cho\'s oeuvre reconciles the identity challenges reflecting his life experiences caught in between South Korean customs and American mores. Cho received a Bachelor of Arts in Interdisciplinary Arts Practices with emphasis in installation arts from University of Colorado, Colorado Springs. Cho has exhibited his work in numerous galleries in Colorado including solo exhibitions and artist in residency. Cho was shown as a featured artist in Gallery of Contemporary Arts, Colorado Springs, CO, Understudy, Denver, Colorado, Artworks Center for Contemporary Art, Loveland, Denver, installed public sculpture in Aurora, Colorado, and an award winning designer at the Fine Arts Center in Colorado Springs, CO.\n\nSu Kaiden Cho condenses a central belief that lies at the core of his artistic practice by delving into issues of ethnic liminality by means of quality of ambiguity or disorientation of identity. Cho\'s practice to bring in otherness, acceptance, challenging norms and inclusion. In his work, he confronts the derogatory terms and attitudes with which Cho continues to withstand today. His accoutrements are proud connections to his heritage but are also reminders of the loss of identity he has had to endure. Cho manipulates materials through the context of self-identity as he examines with social and cultural clashes between what is internally embraced and externally imposed, as it pertains to race and ethnic identity. Being considered a minority in this culture causes a level of uncertainty regarding his own identity and beauty. Cho\'s work raises questions about common standpoints in how beauty is perceived that then ultimately results in internalized self-deprecation among minority races through visual duality, ambiguity, combing the association with the grotesque, the extreme and the fantastic --Cho states that the truth is hardly ever on the surface, more often than not, the truth can only be found deep inside.',

The two composers were known to disagree about which colors matched musical keys.\n\nWe invite you to come experience these musical pieces through the lens of the visual artist this coming First Friday from 5-8 p.m., and through the end of October during normal business hours.\n\n<em>Photo Credit: Karen Mosbacher - "Sonata for Viola and Piano I: Impetuoso, R.

Each year, our local Litter Letter Project produces a unique piece of sculptural art that is constructed with trash collected from public lands and waterways during Creek Week. Modeled after the national Litter Letter Project, and with permission to use their logo and concept, our local Litter Letter Project is a fun and inspiring annual event that signals the official start of Arts Month. It\'s also a wonderful cross-sector collaboration between the Arts, Outdoor Recreation, and Environmental sectors that benefits the entire region!\n\nThe community is invited to participate in several clean-up sessions throughout our local trails and lands during National Public Lands Day (Sept. 25) and in coordination with our local Creek Week cleanups (Sept. 25 - Oct. 3). Participants will gather litter at several designated sites and then fill giant letters made from recycled metal that spell a different word each year. Our past words have been INSPIRE (2018), PRISTINE (2019), and RESILIENT (2020). <strong>This year\'s word is: RESPECT.</strong>\n\nInterested in "adopting" a letter to fill with your Creek Week Cleanup Crew? Email <a href="mailto:creekweeksoco@gmail.com">creekweeksoco@gmail.com</a> for more information.\n\nThe litter letters, constructed by local nonprofit Concrete Couch, will be on display throughout the month of October in celebration of Arts Month. Well-sited on a berm, just off Cimarron Street, east of I-25 and south of America the Beautiful Park, the art piece is also visible from the adjacent trail.\n\nOn Friday, October 1st at 4:00PM, just before the start of First Friday, there will be a dedication ceremony for the 2021 Litter Letter art piece. The dedication event is free and open to the public, and will feature brief remarks by project partners and community leaders. Light snacks and refreshments will be provided, as well as live musical entertainment courtesy of the <a href="https://www.peakradar.com/artist-type/curbside-culture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Curbside Culture</a> program.\n\nFollowing the dedication event, everyone is invited to celebrate the start of Arts Month 2021 by participating in the October First Friday Art Walks from 5-8PM along the Avenue Creative Circuit in Downtown Colorado Springs, Old Colorado City, and Manitou Springs. Throughout the month of October, the local community is also invited to support our Litter Letter Project though a special social media campaign on Instagram, by using the hashtag #PikesPeakLitterLetters to show us how you recreate responsibly, and RESPECT the outdoors.\n\nMedia inquiries and questions about the project should be directed to Andy Vick at <a href="mailto:andy@CulturalOffice.org">andy@CulturalOffice.org</a>.',

A special $50 award for Best-of-Show will also be awarded by the judges. All contest entries will be displayed online in a virtual art exhibition.\n\nThe event will also include a self-guided inner solar system tour at the Cool Science Festival located on the UCCS campus on September 9 from 10 AM - 4 PM. The tour starts at the Planet Walk table (which will represent the Sun) near the Student Union on campus and extend as far as Mars, on the western edge of campus.  If you like the idea of seeing Mars, but not the idea of zero oxygen, food or Starbucks, visit Mars with us, not with Elon Musk!\n\nIn honor of Halloween, everyone is invited to come out (costumed or not) and walk the inner planets, experiencing the temporary planet markers that represent our amazing solar system--starting with the marker for the Sun at our display table. Selected art entries will be displayed at UCCS, near our event table (and on the Planet Walk website throughout the coming year) for all to appreciate our community creativity inspired by Space!',

The album peaked at #2 of the Billboard Top Selling blues albums chart. Recorded in Nashville, TN and produced by four-time Grammy winner Keb\' Mo\', the blues influenced album features guest appearances from Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Robben Ford and Keb\' Mo\'.\n\nA trending theme in today\'s world is women overcoming obstacles and breaking through the glass ceilings to reach the top. Like It On Top celebrates those that take initiative, develop, inspire and motivate. But it also credits the men who are motivated and enlightened enough to support women in their quest to be their best versions of themselves.\n\n"I hope that my music inspires others to motivate ladies all over the world to be successful, energetic, empowered women on a mission, and to motivate men to give them that chance," Popovic says. "The majority of women need to work harder than men to prove themselves or need to cope with a feeling of constant pressure to never make a mistake and be perfect. I believe that women no longer only have the right to earn a living and to take care of themselves and their families. The time has come to step it up. Becoming the outstanding leaders of tomorrow. Corner-office ladies in business, politics, and the electric guitar!"\n\nMoving west:\n\nAna has been moving west all her life. She fell in love with American blues as a kid, starting back home in Belgrade, Serbia (ex-Yugoslavia), then moved to the Netherlands to study at the conservatory of jazz and world-music. She lived in Amsterdam for over ten years, and then in a single-minded pursuit of her art and career, she relocated to Memphis, TN to record and work with Southern musicians. Finally, two years ago, she moved her family to Los Angeles, California where she now lives.\n\nCalled "one helluva a guitar-player" by Bruce Springsteen and nominated for six Blues Music Awards, Ana has appeared on the covers of Vintage Guitar and Guitar Player magazine. Her albums \'Can You Stand The Heat\' and \'Unconditional\' were USA Today Picks-Of-The-Week and featured on NPR Weekend Edition, who praised her "Fiery technique on the Stratocaster". Nearly all of Ana\'s albums reached the top of the Billboard Blues Charts. She and her six-piece band have toured tirelessly, sharing stages with B.B. King, Buddy Guy, Jeff Beck, Joe Bonamassa and many others.',

And with the father-son pairing of Jeff and Jaime Hanna, the band carries on a country music tradition of blood harmony.\n\n"The energy these days is so up -- and our fans have responded in a really great way," Hanna says. "As a fan of other bands, I know how complicated it can be when members come and go. You can either embrace that or you don\'t. Our fans are really gracious and I appreciate that. It\'s been a really good run and there\'s a lot of daylight ahead of us."',

 {'content': u'The Gold Room is excited to announce their musician residency featuring the brand-new Colorado band, The STNDRD. The residency will run every Wednesday for twelve weeks. Every other week The STNDRD will also feature a unique Colorado artist performing their own music with the band. The shows will start at 7:30 p.m. and run until 9:30 p.m.\n\nThe STNDRD is a group of eclectic Colorado musicians focused in jazz and modern R&amp;B, with a sound that is straight and clean and jazzier than jazz, with hints of neo-soul. The group has a strong collective background in gospel music and blends that knowledge with a passionate success. Their selections of music range from artist inspirations such as Robert Glasper, Jill Scott, and Herbie Hancock, to name a few.\n\nFeaturing the sounds of Derek E. Greaves Jr. (keys), Caleb Sutton (keys), David Musante (guitar), Jon Johnson (bass), and Matt Campbell, The STNDRD is a group of musicians that connects people from all walks of life with timeless classics to fresh new hits. Their delicately constructed melodies and high-level musicianship will no doubt bring the crowd back every week for a unique musical experience than cannot be replicated.',

Today we often see multi-generational families join us during the holidays each year and we can\'t wait to see them again in 2021."',

Awaken Creative\'s Coffee Shop Pop-Ups are designed to bring the community together for fun &amp; meaningful shared experiences, presented by our very own GhostLight Ensemble, a group of highly creative people who are passionate and concerned about our world today.\n\nFrom July through November, we\'ll present 4 \'Coffee Shop Pop-Ups,\' each with all new material, filled with comedy, stories, music, friendly competition, poetry, and more. We will explore our themes in a different way, with the goal of easing our community towards a commitment to making change through original pieces, including <strong>"The Last ShowStopper</strong>," a live sitcom that takes place in--you guessed it--a nostalgic video rental store, as well as<strong> "Micro--&gt;Macro"</strong>, our original live game show (with prizes from local businesses)!\n\nAlso, sprinkled throughout each Pop-Up will be more creative explorations of our theme: <strong>"barriers and gateways to unity and reconciliation."</strong> Think of it like SNL with a meaningful twist!\n\nKIDS? While there will be nothing "inappropriate" for kiddos at our Pop-Ups, these events are created primarily for adults (+ teens) in our community to tackle tough issues in a lighthearted and meaningful way.',

 {'content': u"Pioneers. Innovators. These are but a few of the monikers that Yonder Mountain String Band has worn since their inception. From the first Yonder shows in the fall of 1998 to their drive-in tour of 2020, this touring force has brought their adventurous musical spirit to countless venues for nearly a quarter century.\n\nYonder Mountain's early success was fueled by their desire to make a sound distinctly their own, whether performed on crowded stages or selling out the hallowed Red Rocks Amphitheater. Their traditional take on bluegrass sound was fused with their diverse musical influences ranging anywhere from punk rock to the Grateful Dead.\n\nThe combination of the band's unique personalities, extended musical improvisations, their jam band fan culture and their collaborative effort on writing and arranging original songs which span multiple genres--attracted more of a freewheeling jam crowd than the traditional bluegrass scene which, in turn, exposed a whole new generation of fans to Bluegrass.\n\nThis past April, the band recorded their ninth studio album, scheduled to be released in late 2021. The band will road test the new material this summer and fall.",

 {'content': u"Working across printmaking, drawing, sculpture, and installation, Ronny Quevedo uses schematics--from dressmakers' pattern sheets to architectural plans to geographical maps--in order to explore the formation of individual identity that is shaped by a fractured past. References to zoot suits are brought into conversation with Quechua culture, while Mesoamerican ballcourts are placed next to diagrams of soccer stadiums. Intentionally conflating time, space and languages, the artist maps relations between distinct histories, narratives, and visual forms.\n\nAt the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center, Quevedo premieres newly commissioned large-scale works, including a new floor installation composed of reclaimed wood sourced from a professional basketball court. The artist selected pieces from the section of the court commonly known as the paint, broke them apart and reconfigured them, then overlaid them with a new diagram. This work is the latest in a series of architectural projects related to historic and contemporary playing fields, including Mesoamerican ball courts, basketball courts, and indoor soccer fields--sites that provide spaces for collective assembly. In this way, the series considers the role of the individual within a larger collective while also reflecting on the rules and inconsistencies that govern labor, movement, and migration.",

 {'content': u'The exhibition begins with the Cyborgs, a science fiction based series depicting half human/half machine beings. It continues through his East Village days, his earliest forays into sculpture and kinetic art, and the repurposing of a multitude of found materials. Visitors to the exhibit will have the opportunity to not only see a myriad of unique and thoughtful pieces, but to also see a physical representation of the timeline of Lombardi\'s life.\n\nD. Dominick Lombardi is a 45-year retrospective exhibition curated by T. Michael Martin, featuring 20 distinct chapters of the career of the artist. A catalog accompanies the exhibition, available to view digitally <a href="http://media.icompendium.com/ddlombar_High-Low-Catalogue-D.-Dominick-Lombardi.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://media.icompendium.com/ddlombar_High-Low-Catalogue-D.-Dominick-Lombardi.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1628729049968000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGvLSiJ2MlJNhafrOhtYnd315ROPQ">here.</a>\n\nA common thread throughout Lombardi\'s work is his interest in blending qualities of highbrow and lowbrow art, and experimentation with various media. His life-long journey began with his exposure to modern art when he first saw a reproduction of Picasso\'s Guernica (1939) at the age of 3 or 4, and continued with his introduction to the seductive world of Zap Comix in 1968.\n\nThe exhibition begins with the <em>Cyborgs</em>, a science fiction based series depicting half human/half machine beings. It continues through his East Village days, his earliest forays into sculpture and kinetic art, and the repurposing of a multitude of found materials. A pivotal point in his art career was the <em>Post Apocalyptic Tattoo</em> series, which was prompted by his concerns for the environment and how it would impact our future. After the downturn in the economy in 2008, he began the <em>Street Urchin</em> series that focused on the marginalized victims of that era. Most recently he has explored the social issues of our time referencing the roots of human morality.\n\nVisitors to the exhibit will have the opportunity to not only see a myriad of unique and thoughtful pieces, but to also see a physical representation of the timeline of Lombardi\'s life. The exhibition is curated by T. Michael Martin, Director of the Clara M. Eagle Gallery at Murray State University, in Murray, Kentucky, where it premiered in 2019. A catalog accompanies the exhibition.\n\nCurator T. Michael Martin writes about the artist: "Lombardi\'s masterful mix of high and low culture is as current as the day it was created, showing how little the aesthetics of human behavior have changed. In some ways, Lombardi\'s distortions are a more truthful look at society than our daily facade of polite policy and political correctness, especially in the way we prompt contention, as Lombardi offers a much-needed change and disruption through his unique sense of humor. Common throughout the works, Lombardi reveals source, influence, and process that allow the viewer a glimpse into the stages of his creations. They are, in essence, an open interpretation, veiled in playfulness, to put forth a more in-depth investigation of some very real concerns. His narrative is staged, directed, and then morphed through mostly unconventional combinations, as the resulting compositions encourage us to investigate beyond the surface of each work. A suggested glimpse into an apocalyptic breakdown of society, where we are allowed to emerge charged, reconfigured, and prepared to push forward, is a cunning execution where questions flow and commentary is made as the viewer reexamines the world revealed around them."',

This includes more than 2,000 acres of incredible parkland - which, 148 years later, still includes some of the most sweeping, majestic views in the world.  Examples of parkland gifts from Palmer include: Alamo, Acacia, Antlers, Monument Valley and Palmer Park.\n\nAnother of Palmer's amazing legacies to our community is our tree-lined city.  When he founded our city in 1871, it was a nearly treeless, arid plain. Palmer changed that by planting thousands of trees in our city. To celebrate our 150th anniversary in 2021 and carry on Palmer's vision of a tree-lined city, we are challenging the community to help plant 18,071 new trees over the next two years.",

 {'content': u'A new comedy from Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Lynn Nottage (<em>Intimate Apparel</em>) draws on the screwball films of the 1930\'s to take a funny and irreverent look at racial stereotypes in Hollywood. <em>By the Way, Meet Vera Stark</em> is a seventy-year journey through the life of Vera Stark, a headstrong Black maid and budding actress, and her tangled relationship with her boss, a white Hollywood star desperately trying to hold on to her career. When circumstances collide and both women land roles in the same Southern epic, the story behind the cameras leaves Vera with a surprising and controversial legacy scholars will debate for years to come.\n\n"The first act, in which Vera angles for a role, is in the style of a screwball comedy.... The second act, which shifts between a 2003 symposium, steeped in academese, and a 1973 talk show, steeped in gin, is more like a screwball tragedy" --<em>The New York Times</em>\n\n"A satisfying screwball comedy in which Nottage uses stereotypes to expose them, tapping into a current of rueful emotion beneath the surface." --<em>Vogue</em>\n\n<strong>Directed by: Betty Hart</strong>',

 {'content': u'THEATREdART presents Puerto Rican Nocturne, a play written by Jonathan Marcantoni and directed by AB Lugo and performed at the All Souls Unitarian Universalist Church (ASUUC)\n\nAct 1 takes place from 1973-1980 and Act 2 takes place from 1983-1987.\n\nThis recording was shot on a Fuji XT-20 by Sabriel Rivera of Down by the Rivera productions and edited by Rachel Weldon.\n\nWe were unable to open the show on March 13th, 2020 because of measures taken to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Watch an passionate final dress rehearsal before the cancellation of all live events in Colorado Springs. This remains the only live performance of this production.\n\nPlease donate what you can as THEATREdART wanted to split proceeds to benefit the All Souls Unitarian Universalist Church, the company, and the actors who made this possible.\n\nCredits include all theatrical production credits as they were on the night of dress rehearsal. Director\'s note included in closing credits. Spanish subtitles not available in virtual recording.\n\nSynopsis:\n\nPuerto Rico, 1978: A group of police officers, led by undercover detective Alejandro Gonzalez-Malav?, aka Gonzo, ambush and murder two political activists at a radio tower on Cerro Maravilla. In the ensuing cover-up, they claim that their victims were terrorists, and that killing them was an act of patriotism. Puerto Rican Nocturne offers a fictionalized examination of the fall out of the killings on sociological, political, mental, and spiritual levels as they relate to both Gonzalez-Malav? and Adria, the mother of one of the victims.\n\nThe story follows Gonzo as he loses control of his moment in the spotlight, and Adria as the death of her son makes her question her life as an activist and the way she views her country, her identity, and her relationship to God. Told in a dreamlike, episodic fashion of memory and parallel narratives, Puerto Rican Nocturne questions the way power dynamics and systemic injustice harms not only the poor and marginalized, but also the very people who adhere to the status quo. In shedding light on a conspiracy that should have threatened the fabric of U.S.-Puerto Rican relations, Puerto Rican Nocturne portrays how popular revolt is tampered down during even the most traumatic events, allowing the corrupt and tyrannical to remain in power.\n\nCast:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Adria - Cheerish Evans</li>\n \t<li>Captain Morales - ?ngel M?ndez Soto</li>\n \t<li>Det. Oliveras - Manny B. G?mez</li>\n \t<li>Eusebio - Matt Lockett</li>\n \t<li>Gonzo - Ji??
